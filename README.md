# NBART-Multilingual-Translator
This repository contains a Python script that uses a pre-trained NBART (Neural Bidirectional AutoRegressive Transformer) model to perform multi-lingual translation tasks between several languages. The model was trained on multiple language pairs using data parallelism, allowing it to learn representations across all languages simultaneously.
